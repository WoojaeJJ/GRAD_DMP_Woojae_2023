#Data description

This research is about the recovery or protective effect of fish byproduct derived peptide on muscle loss. The muscle loss is a common age-related health problem in elderly society with different reasons and impact on public health such as loss of independence and medical cost has keep increased. One of the causes of the muscle loss is poor nutrition and the fish protein is consumed throughout the world and contain bioactive compounds. Recent studies clarified that the fish protein has effect on various effects such as anti-hypertension, anti-oxidation, anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammation, enhance muscle synthesis. Therefore, to solve this significant health problem this research project use fish-derived protein source by elucidating the effect on maintaining the balance of muscle protein synthesis and degradation.

#Roles and responsibilities

To begin with, my research project is engaged with fish company because all the raw samples are provided from there. But not directly funded and sub experiment from other researcher who directly funded for his research. In this case, I think my PI needs to be a coordinator for this project and will be responsible for the implementation of the DMP. 
On my research project, there is no other specific data management responsibilities, and roles. But I am mainly producing and managing my research data and have regular meetings with my PI to present achieved data, way forward, plans, and research schedule. PI attends meeting to discuss the result, leave comments about results and lab schedule. 
All my data does not include information of personal nature or secure data such as sensitive data, and confidential data as I mentioned above that this research is not directly funded and does not include any personal, and financial information. Therefore, this data does not need to be protected (unrestricted data) according to OSUâ€™s definition. But I think this sample could have potential on nutraceutical and pharmaceutical that I am thinking of patent after preliminary result. Therefore, this data must be protected from this prospective. So, I am planning to protect this dataset almost like confidential data by sharing data with my PI who is most responsible for this research data.
