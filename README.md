Data Management Plan for GRAD521

Data Overview: 
This research is about the recovery or protective effect of fish byproduct derived peptide on muscle loss. The muscle loss is a common age-related health problem in elderly society with different reasons and impact on public health such as loss of independence and medical cost has keep increased. One of the causes of the muscle loss is poor nutrition and the fish protein is consumed throughout the world and contain bioactive compounds. Recent studies clarified that the fish protein has effect on various effects such as anti-hypertension, anti-oxidation, anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammation, enhance muscle synthesis. Therefore, to solve this significant health problem this research project use fish-derived protein source by elucidating the effect on maintaining the balance of muscle protein synthesis and degradation.
